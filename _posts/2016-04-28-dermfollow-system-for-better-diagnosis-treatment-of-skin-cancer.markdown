Working with a team at Georgia Tech, I helped build DermFollow, a web
application that helps dermatologists make more informed diagnostic and
treatment decisions by performing risk analysis of images uploaded by patients
of their skin lesions.

DermFollow uses deep convolutional and residual neural networks to determine
the likelihood that a patient's skin lesion is malignant, presenting the most
high-risk images (and patients) to the physician.

DermFollow also has an interactive body map for each patient that displays the
patientâ€™s images superimposed over the relevant point on the body. It also
performs patient risk scoring, and presents an interactive, user-friendly
interface for both the physician and patient.
